.SH DESCRIPTION
.B \%winsstr
inserts a string
.I str
before the character at the cursor in window
.I win
as if by calling \fBwinsch\fP(3X) for each
.I char
in
.IR str "."
No line wrapping is performed.
Characters to the right of the cursor are shifted right;
those at the right edge of the window may be lost.
.B \%winsstr
stops inserting if it would have to wrap to the next line to write the
next
.I \%char
in
.IR str "."
The cursor position does not change
(after moving to
.RI ( y ,
.IR x "),"
if specified).
.B \%insnstr
does the same,
but inserts at most
.I n
characters,
or as many as possible
(up to the end of the line)
if
.I n
is negative.
\fB\%ncurses\fP(3X) describes the variants of these functions.
.SH RETURN VALUE
These functions return
.B OK
on success and
.B ERR
on failure.
.PP
In
.IR \%ncurses ","
they return
.B ERR
if
.bP
.I win
is
.IR NULL ","
.bP
.I str
is
.IR NULL ","
or
.bP
an internal \fBwinsch\fP(3X) call returns
.BR ERR "."
.PP
Functions prefixed with \*(``mv\*('' first perform cursor movement and
fail if the position
.RI ( y ,
.IR x )
is outside the window boundaries.
.SH NOTES
All of these functions except
.B \%winsnstr
may be implemented as macros.
.SH EXTENSIONS
.BR \%insnstr ","
.BR \%winsnstr ","
.BR \%mvinsnstr ","
and
.BR \%mvwinsnstr "'s"
acceptance of negative
.I n
values is an
.I \%ncurses
extension.
.SH PORTABILITY
Applications employing
.I \%ncurses
extensions should condition their use on the visibility of the
.B \%NCURSES_VERSION
preprocessor macro.
.PP
X/Open Curses Issue\ 4 describes these functions.
It specifies no error conditions for them.
.PP
SVr4 describes a successful return value only as
\*(``an integer value other than
.IR ERR \*(''. \" Courier roman in source; SVID 4, vol. 3, p. 510
.PP
Issue\ 4 distinguished
.I \%insnstr
and
.I \%winsnstr
from the other functions documented above
by stating they \*(``do not perform wrapping\*(''.
This was probably an error,
since it makes this group of functions inconsistent.
No implementation of
.I curses
manifests this inconsistency,
and Issue\ 7 removed the claim.
.PP
Issue\ 4 states that the entire string is inserted if
.I n
is less than 1.
This is probably an error,
.\" ...copied from SVID 4, which made the same error; see p. 510.
because it is inconsistent with other functions
such as
.IR \%waddstr ","
and differs from the SVr4
.I curses
and Solaris
.I xcurses
implementations.
Nevertheless,
Issue\ 7 retains the language.
.SH HISTORY
SVr3.1 (1987)
introduced
.I \%winsstr
and
.I \%winsnstr
and their variants.
.SH SEE ALSO
